### Risk
This definition allows us to conceptualize risks via four quadrants:
1. Low probability, low impact events
2. Low probability, high impact events
3. High probability, low impact events
4. High probability, high impact events
### Threat
A threat is something that poses risk to an asset we care about protecting. Not all threats are human; if our network depends on the local electricity grid, a severe lightning storm could be a threat to ongoing system operations.
A person or group of people embodying a threat is known as a threat actor, 25 a term signifying agency, motivation, and intelligence.

### Vulnerability
For a threat to become an actual risk, the target being threatened must be vulnerable in some manner. A vulnerability is a flaw that allows a threat to cause harm. Not all flaws are vulnerabilities.
In computer programs, vulnerabilities occur when someone who interacts with the program can achieve specific objectives that are unintended by the programmer. When these objectives provide the user with access or privileges that they aren’t supposed to have, and when they are pursued deliberately and maliciously, the user’s actions become an exploit.

### Exploit
The word exploit in cybersecurity can be used as both a noun and as a verb. As a noun, an exploit is a procedure for abusing a particular vulnerability. As a verb, to exploit a vulnerability is to perform the procedure that reliably abuses it.

### Attack Surface
An *attack surface* describes all the points of contact on our system or network that could be vulnerable to exploitation.

### Attack Vector
An *attack vector* is a specific vulnerability and exploitation combination that can further a threat actor’s objectives. Defenders attempt to reduce their attack surfaces as much as possible, while attackers try to probe a given attack surface to locate promising attack vectors.
